## Introduction

MoneyGoWhere is a financial planning application to help you manage your finances.

Based on a Command Line Interface (CLI), you can add your `expenses`, `income` sources, spending `targets` and `recurring payments` to a trackable list that can be saved and accessed **anywhere, anytime**.

Although this application is mainly targeted at computing professionals who are familiar with CLI, **you don't have to worry if you're not an expert** -- MoneyGoWhere is **easy to pick up** and can help you start organising your finances in a matter of **moments**.

### Understanding the Command Syntax

<br>

#### Basic Syntax

When inputting arguments:
* The absence of square brackets denotes **mandatory** arguments.
* Square brackets denote **optional** arguments.

<br>

Example: `Add-Expense -n NAME -a AMOUNT [-d DATE_TIME] [-t DESCRIPTION] [-c CATEGORY] [-r REMARKS] [-x CURRENCY] [-p MODE OF PAYMENT]`

{: .invalid }
> `Add-Expense -n Subscription`
> 
> `Add-Expense -a 13.37`

{: .valid }
> `Add-Expense -n Subscription -a 13.37`
> 
> `Add-Expense -n "Cloud subscription" -a 13.37 -d "01/01/2022 2359"`

<br>
<hr>
<br>

#### Additional Syntax

<br>

##### Adding spaces
Argument values with spaces should be enclosed with double quotes.

Example:
```
Add-Expense -n "Birthday items" -a 90.40

Name            : Birthday items
Date and Time   : 01 Jan 2022 23:59
Amount          : 90.40
Currency        : SGD
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

##### Adding double quotes

Argument values with a double quote can be escaped by prepending an additional double quote.

Example:
```
Add-Expense -n """Stuff""" -a 65.77

Name            : Stuff
Date and Time   : 1 Jan 2022 23:59
Amount          : 65.77
Currency        : SGD
``` 

<br>
<hr>
<br>

##### Restriction on adding hyphens

Argument values cannot start with a hyphen.

Example:
```
Add-Expense -n "-Phone Bill" -a -500.00
```
